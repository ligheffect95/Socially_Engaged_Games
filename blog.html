        <h3>Ethnographic Context</h3>
        <p>Building on Clifford's <em>"partial truths"</em> framework, this analysis examines how procedural tools both reveal and obscure designer intentionality...</p>

        <h4>My Notes in Full</h4>
        <p>I want to take this concept from “worlds unfolding - ideas and prompts for virtual world making” to create a non human character with a human form but the way that the player interacts with them in a very unique and role to it. in the glossary, they lay out very neatly, the concept of a prompt, entity and a non human subject A prompt being a guiding question statement or exercise to spark discussion. I think I need to craft my prompt and present it to actual siqpuaq people. 

Entities have a rich history of Syncretism and pluralism in colonized societies that have been preserved through various means. 

examples include: 
Calabar and patriachry inherited from west Africa and the Spanish developing the Abakua secret society
Santeria also in cuba
Sure there are other ones outside Cuba, these ideas however tie directly into my third cinema class.

I want to have smoked salmon embody an entity in the environment that eventually anthropomorphs into a human, or even the water the salmon relies on to flow freely. Explaining to the colonizer Russians that this exploitation and overstaying of their welcome will eventually lead to dam infrastructure and strip mining and eventually, satan 

One thing that’s confusing me about their definition of liner vs non linear storytelling is they actually don’t define either really well but lay out quite effectively how to do it, these definitions feel less a glossary on how to read what they are saying but more a way to replicate these ideas laid out. 

They define simulation as having evolving and possibly infinite outcomes, which in the prospect of designing a game like that is deeply appealing. I still want to return to mine only having one possible outcome that opens up the possibility of the infinite to the player but actually just ends up being an eternal recurrence. (Think all this has happened before, and it will all happen again BSGalactica/Peter Pan lol)

Ok once I got to the intro to the prompts, it’s very obvious this is a how to book. From the intro:

"you may approach these prompts in a linear sequence, building your virtual space layer by layer, or engage with specific sections non-linearly based on your creative focus. We also encourage you to contribute to this evolving conversation. If you feel inspired to add your own prompts or share insights from your creative process, we’d love to hear from you! You can submit your contributions via email (hello@uaad.art) or send us amessage through Instagram DM (@uaad.art).

Let’s build worlds together."

I will likely revisit this text once I have more of a framework and research to work with, I skipped through most of the exersises but I see how they can be benefical in the long run. I really wanted to get to the meat of it all. I saw a flowchart/map of how these prompts all connect on their instagram page, which i will imbed a gif of right now.
